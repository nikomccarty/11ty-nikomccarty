My work has appeared in _Retraction Watch_, _Scientific American_, _Forbes_, _The Counter_ and elsewhere. Prior to journalism, I was a scientist for 7 years, developing CRISPR tools and studying the link between diabetes and heart failure. I worked at the Simons Foundation for one year, where I was the Data Journalist at _Spectrum_, a technical, autism news site.
