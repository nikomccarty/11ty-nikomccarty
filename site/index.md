I am a science writer and editor based in Cambridge, MA. Currently, I'm the Head of Media for <a href="https://newscience.org/">New Science</a>, a 501c3 nonprofit that is building "21st century institutions of basic science." I'm always looking for essay ideas about what works in science, what could be better, and case studies of beautiful biology experiments. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:niko@newscience.org">niko@newscience.org</a>. I also write <a href="https://codonmag.com">Codon Magazine</a>, a newsletter that tracks research in synthetic biology.
